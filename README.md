## Logistic regression model using numpy.

- Compute cost in the forward propogation
- Compute gradient in the backward propogation
- Use ssigmoid activation function
- Optimize the weights and bias and thus the loss function(Cross-Entropy)
- Trained and evaluated the model parameters and metrics using iris dataset
